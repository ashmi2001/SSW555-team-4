# SSW555 Agile Sprinters (Team 4)
## Project Introduction
Our objectives with this project are to create a mobile app with an easy-to-use interface, specifically targeted towards elderly consumers who would not have much experience with technology. The app would allow users to talk with our AI chat bot. Our emphasis for these conversations would be tracking how the user is feeling. 

The chat bot would ask certain questions throughout the day to gather input from the user as to how they are feeling and health related questions such as nutrition and exercise related questions. Based on this feedback the chat bot would be able to provide potential solutions, support, suggestions, motivation, and recognition to the user for their efforts. Through the feedback we get from the user, we would securely store the data and display the data in an easy to view format to track how the user has been feeling over time. This data could also be helpful to healthcare professionals working with the user.

In addition, another large factor of our application is gamification strategies to keep the user engaged and using the app. As one concern with this app would be creating something that elderly and tech adverse users would be interested and excited about using, coming back to, and providing honest information.
